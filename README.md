# STG-game
my first python project!


requiring:

python, pygame, a couple photos


setting:

The game is inspired by plastic pollution to the ocean in reality. 

Some plastic bags are thrown into the ocean and a shark is suffering from the threat.
He is going to clean up the plastic bags with yellew bullets and may die from touching the plastic bags.
Once the shark is died or the plastic pollutants hit the ocean floor, the game will be reset.

Hope you can both enjoy the game & realize the issue that marine organisms are facing!


Instructions:

play button on the screen--start
space botton--end
slash botton--fire bullets
up, down, left, right botton--movement
